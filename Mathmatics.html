                <h3 class="S2">Dynamics</h3>
                <p>Dynamics is a branch of mechanics that studies the motion of objects
                and the forces that cause them. It's crucial for understanding how things move, 
                from planets in orbit to cars on a road. This field utilizes principles like Newton's laws 
                of motion to predict and analyze the behavior of systems under various influences.</p>

                <h3 class="S4">Calculus</h3>
                <p>Differentiation, a core concept in calculus, deals with the rate at which a quantity changes. 
                It's fundamental for understanding slopes of curves, optimization problems, 
                and how functions behave. This mathematical tool is widely applied in fields like physics, 
                engineering, and economics to model and analyze dynamic systems.</p>
